Introduction
============

Friendly TOM is your Friendly Tour Operations Manager - he is here to help you
manage all the details and deadlines in the business of a tour operator. Why? 
Because the tour operator business can be a messy business!

There are all kinds of deadlines involved when booking things like hotels and
cruises. First you place a blocking which must be confirmed by a certain date, 
and then the booking must be paid - first by one or more deposits and then
the balance payment. Or maybe you have favorable terms with your supplier and
can pay on credit?

The terms that detail this process vary from supplier to supplier, and each
supplier may have multiple different sets of terms depending on the type of
booking and which of your customers the booking is on behalf of. Friendly TOM
helps you apply the terms correctly to each individual booking - you just have
to tell him the terms once, and you'll never have to look up those terms again!

But figuring out when to confirm blockings and pay bookings is just part of the 
tour operator business - you also need to know how much to pay. Friendly TOM
helps you here by calculating how much you need to transfer for each payment,
taking into account VAT and tax retention rules.
